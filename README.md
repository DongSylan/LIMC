The codes are used to realize the matrix completion.
1. All the codes are written by Wendong Wang, the first author of the paper titled "Enhancing Matrix Completion Using a Modified Second-order Total Variation".
2. Our algorithm is coded in LIMC.m and LIMC_Ecnomic.m files. The 'LIMC' is short for Local Information based Matrix Completion (LIMC).
